In particular you should see the function “RightSideHut” and “Tornado”. In “RightSideHut” I spent so many hours working on creating the hut to an exact replica. This was very difficult as something that looks like “one piece” is a mixture of triangles and trapezoids.

In the function “tornado” you can see how I created the tornado and how I made it animate back and forth on the map. By using glTranslate and glRotate (in that specific order) I was able to make the tornado! This also took a long time to figure out the correct way to loop each frame, but in the end it worked out!
